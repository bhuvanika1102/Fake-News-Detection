# Fake News Detection

This project aims to predict fake news or misinformation using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset is divided into training and testing sets, and a decision tree algorithm is applied to achieve accurate predictions. Additionally, several visualization techniques, such as heat maps and best-fit lines, are used to help with the predictions and provide a visual summary of the data.

## Project Overview

The system predicts fake news or misinformation by training various machine learning models on a given dataset. The accuracy is calculated, and actual and predicted values are compared. To help with the predictions, visualizations such as best-fit lines and heat maps are used to provide an immediate visual summary of the information.

## Algorithms Used

- **Decision Tree:** Applied to the training set to predict fake news and calculate accuracy.
- **Simple Linear Regression:** Predicts a response using a single feature, assuming a linear relationship between variables.
- **Logistic Regression:** Predicts the categorical dependent variable using a given set of independent variables.
- **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble tree-based algorithm that builds decision trees on different samples for classification and regression problems.

## Dataset

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets. It contains features and labels that indicate whether a news article is fake or real.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd fake-news-detection
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset by dividing it into training and testing sets.
2. Train the machine learning models:
    ```sh
    python train.py
    ```
3. Evaluate the models and generate visualizations:
    ```sh
    python evaluate.py
    ```
4. View the results:
    ```sh
    python results.py
    ```

## Results

The results include the accuracy of the models, actual and predicted values, and visualizations such as best-fit lines and heat maps. These visualizations provide an immediate and comprehensive summary of the information.
